*DESCRIPTION*: This project is a fun and interactive web-based quiz app created to test your knowledge in a simple and engaging way. Built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s a great example of how basic web technologies can come together to create something functional, clean, and enjoyable.
The main part of the app starts on the index.html page, where users can begin the quiz. The questions appear one at a time, with multiple-choice answers displayed as clickable buttons. Everything is neatly laid out and easy to understand, thanks to the custom styling in the style.css file. The design keeps things bright, clear, and user-friendly—making it a smooth experience even for someone using it for the first time.
Behind the scenes, the quiz runs on the logic written in script.js. This script handles everything from displaying the questions, keeping track of which one you’re on, checking your answers, and updating your score in real time. It also stores your final score when you're done—most likely using the browser’s local storage—so it can be displayed on the leaderboard later.
Speaking of the leaderboard, that’s another neat feature of this project. After finishing the quiz, your score gets added to a list of top scores on a separate page: leaderboard.html. This adds a bit of a competitive edge and encourages users to try again and beat their previous scores. The leaderboard.js file takes care of pulling those scores from storage and displaying them on the page in a dynamic way.
Visually, the whole project sticks to a consistent design. The style.css file is shared across both pages to make sure everything looks connected and polished. The fonts, button styles, and layout choices help keep things light and fun—just as you’d expect from a quiz meant to bring a bit of joy while testing your knowledge.
What makes this project stand out is its simplicity and clarity. It doesn’t rely on any complicated frameworks or server-side code, which makes it perfect for beginners looking to practice their front-end skills. At the same time, it shows how even basic tools can be used to build something with real features—like interactive questions, scoring, and a working leaderboard.It serves as an excellent template for beginners who want to understand how front-end technologies can be used together to create a functional application.
Overall,this project is a thoughtfully crafted project that combines learning with fun. It demonstrates the developer’s grasp of essential web development principles while delivering a product that users can genuinely enjoy. With room for future enhancements—such as adding more question categories, introducing timers, or integrating a back-end for persistent data—this project provides a strong foundation upon which more complex features can be built.
In short, this task is a cheerful and effective quiz app that blends creativity with practical coding skills. It’s a great stepping stone for anyone learning web development, and it’s easy to imagine adding more to it in the future—like different quiz categories, timers, or even a login system. For this project I have referred youtube,google and chatgpt.
